# Template used and edited is: [Global: HTML5 website template]

# In the website's current state, I used the above template, and edited the HTML code to fit how I wanted the website to flow and what to include. Currently, the hyperlinks direct the user to a wix.com version of my personal website, that provides more information about myself. In the forseeable future, custom-made HTML files that I create will be used for that information!
